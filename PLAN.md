## 30-Day Launch Roadmap

### Week 1 — Make It Real (Est. 5hrs total)
| # | Task | TODO | Hours |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Fix contact form metadata bug | #223 | 0.5 |
| 2 | Add Resend API route for contact form | #221 | 2.0 |
| 3 | Deploy to Vercel + custom domain | #222 | 1.0 |
| 4 | Add Google Analytics | #225 | 1.0 |
| 5 | Add Calendly embed | #224 | 1.0 |

**Goal:** Revenue-generating website with real lead capture.

### Week 2 — Conversion Optimization
- Add testimonials/quotes section (2-3 real client quotes)
- Add case study teasers with CTAs
- A/B test hero headline
- Add spam protection (Cloudflare Turnstile) to contact form
- Improve mobile navigation

### Week 3 — SEO Content Push
- Publish 3 blog posts targeting high-intent keywords:
  1. "AI automation for financial services"
  2. "AI strategy consulting ROI"
  3. "Enterprise AI implementation guide"
- Add FAQ schema to services page
- Internal linking audit

### Week 4 — Automation & Scale
- Set up n8n webhook: new lead → Slack alert → HubSpot contact
- Add Resend newsletter capture
- Create ROI Calculator interactive tool
- Set up monthly blog publishing schedule

## Dependency Graph

```
#223 (metadata fix)
    ↓
#221 (contact form backend)
    ↓
#222 (deploy to Vercel)  ← #224 (Calendly)
    ↓
#225 (analytics) ← deploy must happen first for real GA data
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Contact Form Backend
**Chosen:** Resend API + Next.js API route
- Nathan already uses Resend-compatible tools
- Zero vendor lock-in
- Easy to extend with webhook to n8n

### Form Splitting Pattern
```
src/app/contact/
  page.tsx          ← Server component, exports metadata
  ContactForm.tsx   ← Client component with useState
```

### Future CMS (Month 2)
If blog grows beyond 5 posts, add **Contentlayer** for MDX-based blog.
No external CMS needed — keeps it free and code-controlled.

| Next.js 16 canary instability | LOW | MEDIUM | Pin to 15.x stable if issues arise |
| No spam on open form | MEDIUM | LOW | Add Turnstile Week 2 |

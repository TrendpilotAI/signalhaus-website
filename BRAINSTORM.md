## 1. New Features (Revenue/Value Impact)

### HIGH PRIORITY
- **Testimonials Section** [S] — Add 3-5 client testimonials to homepage. Social proof = conversion rate increase. Add headshots, name, title, company.
- **Case Studies Page** [M] — 2-3 detailed case studies (BNY Pershing, Invesco). Show problem → solution → measurable results. Huge trust signal.
- **ROI Calculator** [M] — Interactive "How much could you save?" calculator on pricing page. Drives engagement and pre-qualifies leads.
- **Newsletter Signup** [S] — Email capture with ConvertKit/Beehiiv for "AI Automation Weekly" or similar. Builds owned audience.
- **Demo/Video Section** [M] — Loom or Wistia embed showing a real automation workflow. Visualizes the value proposition.
- **More Blog Posts** [M] — 5-10 SEO-targeted posts: "AI automation for wealth management", "How to automate CRM with AI", etc.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **LinkedIn Social Proof** — Embed or pull in LinkedIn recommendations/endorsements
- **Featured In Media** — Real logo images (not text badges) for WEF, Harvard Alumni, AI Hot 100
- **FAQ Section** — Common objections answered on pricing page
- **Resource Library** — Gated PDF downloads (e.g., "AI Automation Checklist") for lead capture

## 2. Code Quality

- **Badge Images** [S] — Badges rendered as text divs. Should be real `<img>` elements with actual logos or SVGs. Currently looks like a placeholder.
- **Metadata DRY** [S] — Each page re-declares full OG metadata. Extract `generateMetadata` base config into `src/lib/metadata.ts`.
- **No `next/image`** [M] — OG image and any future images should use `<Image>` from next/image for optimization.
- **Missing `lint` script** [S] — `package.json` has no `lint` or `format` script. Add ESLint + Prettier.
- **No `.eslintrc`** [S] — No linting config present.
- **Type Safety** [S] — Contact API route has no Zod validation on request body.

---

## 3. Testing

- **Zero tests exist** — No unit, integration, or E2E tests at all.
- **E2E with Playwright** [M] — Test: homepage load, contact form submission, pricing page render.
- **API route tests** [S] — Mock Resend and test `/api/contact` validates inputs and returns correct status codes.
- **Accessibility tests** [S] — axe-playwright for WCAG compliance checks.

---

## 4. Integrations

- **HubSpot CRM** [M] — On contact form submit, create a contact in HubSpot with source=website, page=contact.
- **Calendly** [S] — Already in contact page. Add inline embed to homepage CTA section too.
- **ConvertKit/Beehiiv** [S] — Newsletter capture on blog pages + footer.
- **LinkedIn Insight Tag** [S] — Add for B2B retargeting (enterprise buyers are on LinkedIn).
- **Slack Notification** [S] — Webhook to Honey/Nathan's Slack on new contact form submission.
- **Vercel Analytics** [S] — Already has GA4, but Vercel Analytics is zero-config and gives Core Web Vitals.

---

## 5. Workflows

- **ESLint + Prettier** [S] — Add to package.json, add pre-commit hook via husky + lint-staged.
- **GitHub Actions** [S] — Already has CI. Add: type-check step, lint step, Playwright E2E step.
- **Vercel Preview Deployments** — Enable preview deploys for every PR (should work automatically with Vercel/GitHub integration).
- **Dependabot** [S] — Already configured per git log. Good.
- **Semantic PR titles** — Add PR title linter for conventional commits.

---

## 6. Performance

- **Bundle size audit** [S] — Run `next build` and check bundle analysis. Add `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
- **Image optimization** [M] — Badge logos should be SVGs served via `next/image`. OG image is already static.
- **Font optimization** [S] — Ensure `next/font` is used (not CDN font import) for zero CLS.
- **Lazy loading** [S] — Blog page and heavy sections should use React Suspense.
- **Lighthouse score** — Target 95+ on all metrics. Run PageSpeed Insights on signalhaus.ai.

---

## 7. Security

- **Contact API — No rate limiting** [HIGH] — `/api/contact/route.ts` has no rate limiting. Add `@upstash/ratelimit` or simple IP-based check.
- **Contact API — No input validation** [HIGH] — Add Zod schema validation for name, email, message fields.
- **CORS** [MEDIUM] — API route has no CORS headers. Fine for same-origin, but add explicit headers.
- **CSP Headers** [MEDIUM] — No Content-Security-Policy headers in `next.config.ts`. Add via `headers()`.
- **npm audit** — Run to check for known CVEs in dependencies.

---

## 8. SEO / Content

- **JSON-LD Organization Schema** [S] — Add structured data for SignalHaus as an Organization with sameAs links.
- **JSON-LD Service Schema** [S] — Add Service schema for each service offering on /services.
- **Internal Linking** [S] — Blog post should link to /services and /pricing pages.
- **More Blog Content** [M] — Target keywords: "AI automation for financial services", "enterprise AI consulting", "workflow automation ROI".
- **Canonical Tags** — Already present on most pages. Verify all pages have canonical.
- **sitemap.xml** — Static sitemap present. Should be dynamic to auto-include new blog posts.

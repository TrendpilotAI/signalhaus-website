# SignalHaus Website — Brainstorm

*Generated by Judge Agent v2 — 2026-02-27*

## Current State
Next.js 16 marketing site for SignalHaus AI consultancy. Good bones: professional Tailwind design, SEO setup, pricing tiers. Critical gaps: fake contact form, undeployed, no analytics, no booking flow.

---

## Priority 1 — Critical (Must Ship to Generate Revenue)

### 1. Fix Contact Form Backend [S — 2hrs]
**Problem:** `onSubmit` just sets `submitted=true`. Zero leads are captured.
**Solution:** Integrate [Resend](https://resend.com) API or [Formspree](https://formspree.io) for zero-config form handling. Alternatively, POST to an n8n webhook that emails Nathan + creates a HubSpot contact.
**Recommendation:** Resend API route in Next.js (`/api/contact`) — Nathan already has Resend-compatible tools.

### 2. Deploy to Vercel [S — 1hr]
**Problem:** Site is built but not live. Every day offline = missed leads.
**Solution:** Follow DEPLOY.md. Push repo to GitHub (TrendpilotAI org), import to Vercel, add `www.signalhaus.ai` domain.
**Acceptance:** `https://www.signalhaus.ai` returns 200.

### 3. Add Calendly Booking Widget [S — 1hr]
**Problem:** CTA says "Book a Free Consultation" but goes to a form. Friction kills conversions.
**Solution:** Embed Calendly inline on the contact page OR add a floating "Book a Call" button sitewide. Calendly's embed script makes this trivial.
**Acceptance:** Visitors can book a call without leaving the site.

## Priority 2 — High Impact (Ship Week 2)

### 4. Analytics Integration [S — 1hr]
**Options:**
- **Plausible** (privacy-first, GDPR-compliant, looks good in sales calls) — $9/mo
- **Google Analytics 4** (free, integrates with Search Console)
**Recommendation:** GA4 for SEO data + Plausible for the privacy story with enterprise clients.

### 5. Fix Metadata Bug in Contact Page [XS — 30min]
**Problem:** `contact/page.tsx` uses `"use client"` but tries to export metadata via `<head>` tags — this is the wrong pattern and won't be picked up by Next.js metadata system properly.
**Solution:** Split into a server component wrapper that exports `metadata` and a client component for the form logic.

### 6. Lead Magnet / ROI Calculator [M — 1 day]
**Idea:** "AI Automation ROI Calculator" — enter headcount, manual process hours, we show estimated savings. Captures emails in exchange for results. High conversion for enterprise buyers.
**Alternative:** Downloadable "2025 AI Automation Playbook for Financial Services" PDF (targets Nathan's existing network).

### 7. Testimonials / Social Proof Section [S — 2hrs]
**Problem:** Badges (Harvard, WEF, AWS) are good but static. Quotes from real clients close deals.
**Solution:** Add a testimonials carousel on homepage. Even 2-3 strong quotes dramatically improve conversion.

## Priority 3 — SEO & Content (Ongoing)

### 8. More Blog Posts [M — 2-3hrs each]
Current: 1 post. Need: 10+ for SEO traction.
**Recommended topics:**
- "5 AI Automations Every Financial Services Firm Should Deploy in 2025"
- "The Real Cost of Manual GTM Processes (And How to Fix It)"
- "How We Reduced Invesco's Sales Cycle by 40% with AI"
- "Comparing AI Strategy Consultants: What to Look For"
- "Building Your First AI Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide"

### 9. Case Studies Page [M — 4hrs]
**High value:** Named case studies (BNY Pershing, Invesco, LPL Financial mentioned in hero copy) would be massive conversion drivers. Even anonymized ("Global Asset Manager, $500B AUM").

### 10. Newsletter/Email Capture [S — 1hr]
**Tool:** Resend + simple email list, or ConvertKit.
**Placement:** Footer + blog posts + after ROI calculator.

- Cloudflare Turnstile (free, privacy-friendly) or hCaptcha
- Rate limiting via Vercel Edge Middleware

### 13. Performance Optimization [S — 2hrs]
- Replace emoji icons with proper SVG/Lucide icons (bundle)
- Add `next/image` for OG image references

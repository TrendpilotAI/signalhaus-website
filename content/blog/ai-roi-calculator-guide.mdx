title: "How to Calculate the ROI of Enterprise AI: A Practical Framework"
excerpt: "Most AI projects fail the business case review — not because the technology doesn't work, but because teams can't quantify the value. Here's the framework we use with every client before writing a single line of code."

Every enterprise AI project starts with the same question: "What's the ROI?"

It sounds simple. It isn't. Most teams either inflate projections to get budget approved, or undercount value because they only measure direct cost savings. Both approaches lead to bad decisions.

Here's the framework we use at SignalHaus before recommending any AI investment.

## The Three Categories of AI Value

### 1. Hard Cost Reduction

This is the easy part — labor hours replaced, infrastructure costs avoided, error-related rework eliminated. Calculate it conservatively. If your AI-powered document processing replaces 20 hours/week of analyst time at $75/hour burdened cost, that's $78,000/year. Straightforward.

**Common hard cost wins:**
- Data entry and document extraction
- Report generation and formatting
- Tier-1 customer support deflection
- Compliance monitoring and flagging

### 2. Velocity Gains

This is where most teams leave value on the table. Speed compounds. A sales cycle that shrinks from 45 days to 30 days doesn't just save time — it increases the number of deals you can close in a quarter. Model it as additional revenue capacity, not just time saved.

**Formula:** `(Deals/Quarter) × (Avg Deal Size) × (Cycle Reduction % × Close Rate Improvement %)`

A 25% reduction in sales cycle length typically translates to a 10–15% increase in revenue capacity without adding headcount.

### 3. Risk Reduction & Optionality

The hardest to quantify but often the most valuable. An AI that catches compliance violations before regulators do isn't just saving fine money — it's protecting the brand, the leadership team, and investor confidence. Assign a probability-weighted value to avoided events.

## The Calculation Template

Here's the simplified version we give clients:

```
Year 1 Value =
  (FTE hours saved × burdened hourly rate)
+ (Revenue capacity gain × gross margin)
+ (Risk events avoided × probability × cost per event)
- (Implementation cost + annual licensing + maintenance)
```

For most mid-market implementations, Year 1 ROI lands between 180–350%. The break-even point is typically 4–7 months.

## What to Watch Out For

**Don't double-count.** If you're counting cost savings from replacing a contractor, don't also count the productivity gain from the same task.

**Use conservative adoption rates.** New tools rarely hit 100% adoption on day one. Model 60% adoption in Month 1, 80% by Month 3, 95% by Month 6.

**Account for change management costs.** Training, documentation, and transition time are real costs. Add 15–20% to your implementation estimate.

**Don't forget the run rate.** Year 2 and Year 3 value often exceed Year 1 because adoption matures and you can expand the use case.

## The Bottom Line

AI ROI is real and measurable when you structure the analysis correctly. The mistake most teams make is treating it like a cost center analysis instead of a revenue and capacity model.

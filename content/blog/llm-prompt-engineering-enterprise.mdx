There's a gap between prompt engineering tutorials and production AI systems.

Tutorials teach you to be creative with prompts. Production systems need prompts that are deterministic enough to test, structured enough to parse, and robust enough to survive user input that you didn't anticipate.

Here's how we approach prompts in the enterprise systems we build at SignalHaus.

## The Production Prompt Stack

We think about prompts in three layers:

**System prompt** — the invariant layer. Defines the model's role, constraints, output format, and fallback behaviors. This rarely changes.

**Few-shot examples** — the calibration layer. Concrete examples of correct inputs and outputs. These are your unit tests for the model. Update them when you find failure cases.

**Dynamic context** — the variable layer. Retrieved documents, user history, current state. This is what changes per request.

Separating these layers makes prompts easier to test, debug, and version-control.

## Structured Output Is Non-Negotiable

If you're building a system that needs to parse model output — and almost every enterprise system does — you need structured output. Don't ask the model to "return a JSON object." Use JSON Schema with `response_format` (OpenAI), constrained generation (Anthropic), or output parsers (LangChain, DSPy).

Structured output isn't just more reliable — it's more auditable. When a compliance team asks "how did the model arrive at this recommendation?", you want to show them a structured trace, not a wall of prose.

## The Reliability Triad

For enterprise systems, we optimize for three properties simultaneously:

**Consistency** — the same input should produce functionally equivalent outputs. Achieved through lower temperature settings (0.0–0.3 for factual tasks), clear output schemas, and explicit instructions for edge cases.

**Robustness** — the system should handle unexpected inputs gracefully. Include explicit fallback instructions: "If the input doesn't contain enough information to answer, output `{"confidence": "low", "reason": "insufficient_data"}` rather than guessing."

**Traceability** — every output should be explainable. Include reasoning steps in your schema. A model that outputs `{"recommendation": "approve", "reasoning": "...", "evidence": [...]}` is infinitely more auditable than one that outputs `"approve"`.

## Prompt Versioning and Testing

Prompts are code. Treat them that way.

Store prompts in version control alongside your application code. Tag prompt versions with model versions — a prompt optimized for GPT-4o may perform differently on GPT-4.1 or Claude 3.7. When you update a prompt, run your regression test suite against the new version before deploying.

Your test suite should include:
- Happy path examples (expected inputs, expected outputs)
- Edge cases (ambiguous inputs, missing data, adversarial inputs)
- Failure cases (inputs that should trigger fallback behavior)

We typically aim for 50–100 test cases before promoting a prompt to production.

## The Context Window is Precious

Enterprise systems often have large context windows available — 128K, 200K tokens. The temptation is to stuff everything in. Resist it.

Relevant, dense context outperforms bloated context every time. Implement retrieval — semantic search, keyword search, or hybrid — to find the most relevant information for each query. Then inject only what's needed.

A well-retrieved 2,000-token context will outperform a poorly-retrieved 20,000-token context, and it costs 10x less.

## Closing Thought

The teams that build reliable enterprise AI systems aren't necessarily using the most powerful models or the most sophisticated architectures. They're the ones who treat prompts as engineering artifacts, invest in test coverage, and build systems that fail gracefully.

Creativity gets demos shipped. Discipline gets products to production.

Enterprise AI projects don't fail because the models are bad. They fail because the data foundation is broken.

We've seen this pattern repeat across dozens of implementations: a technically capable team, a solid use case, executive buy-in — and then a complete stall when reality collides with the data layer. Here are the five pitfalls we see most often, and how to avoid them.

## Pitfall 1: Treating Data Quality as Someone Else's Problem

The AI team assumes the data is clean. The data team assumes the AI team knows what format they need. Nobody checks. By the time the model is being trained, you discover that 40% of the customer records have duplicate entries, phone numbers stored in five different formats, and a field called "revenue" that means something different in each business unit.

**Fix:** Dedicate two weeks at the start of every project to a data quality audit. Run automated profiling tools (Great Expectations, dbt tests, or even a few SQL queries) to characterize completeness, consistency, and accuracy before writing any ML code.

## Pitfall 2: Schema Drift Without Versioning

Your pipeline works perfectly in January. By March, the upstream CRM added three new fields, renamed two others, and deprecated one your model depends on. Nobody told you. The model starts producing garbage outputs silently.

**Fix:** Implement schema contracts and automated schema validation on every ingestion pipeline. Tools like dbt, Apache Avro with Schema Registry, or even a simple JSON Schema check at ingestion time will catch drift before it propagates.

## Pitfall 3: Ignoring Latency Requirements

Batch pipelines are easy to build. But if your use case requires real-time scoring — fraud detection, next-best-action recommendations, dynamic pricing — a nightly ETL job won't cut it. We've seen teams build beautiful offline models that are operationally useless because the data is always 18 hours stale.

**Fix:** Define your latency requirements before you architect the pipeline. Real-time means streaming (Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub). Near-real-time might mean micro-batching (5–15 minute windows). Know what you need before you build.

## Pitfall 4: The "Data Warehouse is the Source of Truth" Fallacy

Your data warehouse is a copy of the truth, aggregated and transformed for analytics. Using it as the source for operational AI introduces consistency issues, join explosions, and stale data. It's also a bottleneck when the warehouse is shared with 40 analysts running reports.

**Fix:** Separate your analytical and operational data patterns. AI systems that need fresh, atomic data should read from operational databases or event streams — not the warehouse. Reserve the warehouse for historical analysis and model training datasets.

## Pitfall 5: No Lineage or Observability

When the model starts misbehaving — and it will — you need to trace the failure back to its source. Without data lineage, you're debugging blind. Which upstream table changed? Which transformation introduced the null values? Which pipeline run corrupted the feature store?

**Fix:** Implement data lineage from day one. Modern tools like dbt, OpenLineage, or Marquez make this tractable. Pair lineage with data observability (Monte Carlo, Metaplane, or Soda) to detect anomalies automatically before they reach your model.

## The Common Thread

Every one of these pitfalls shares a root cause: treating data infrastructure as a solved problem rather than a continuous engineering discipline. The best AI teams we've worked with embed a data engineer in every AI project from sprint one — not brought in at the end to "hook things up."

Data integration isn't the boring part of AI. It's the part that determines whether the whole thing works.
